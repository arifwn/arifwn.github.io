      <h1>Let's Backup Our Servers!</h1>
<p>Backup is something that we all wish we had when faced with a catastrophic loss of data. There are 1001 ways to backup your data, but we're often just too lazy (or simply forgot) to setup one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no way my server would get corrupted! I hosted it on AWS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/#AvailabilityandDurability">EBS has expected to have an annual failure rate between 0.1% - 0.2%</a>. That means, at the very least, 1 out of 1000 EBS volumes on AWS will encounter an EBS failure within a given year. If you're (un)lucky, that one EBS volume could be in your server!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My host would take care of such basic thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except they most certainly don't. Most VPS providers expect their customer to backup their own data, or purchase an additional plan for backup purpose (snapshotting, off-site NFS mounts, etc). Even if you're on a shared hosting provider, they are likely to have inadequate backup plan for cost saving reason (especially now with a lot of competitors driving down price). When a hosting company forced to cut down cost, the first thing to do is tuning down their costly backup policy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My data is worthless. If it were gone I won't lose anything valuable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, now it might be just a silly side project. Why bother backing it up at all? Except when you suddenly gain overnight success and forgot you have no back up in place. <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2011/08/01/third-largest-bitcoin-exchange-bitomat-lost-their-wallet-over-17000-bitcoins-missing/">Don't be that bitcoin exchange site</a> that lost all of their data when updating their server configuration just because the forgot to set up an off-site backup for their <em>silly</em> side project and ended up losing their customers' money.</p>
<h1>How much will it cost to backup all my production data?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Storage cost scale linearly. The more backup archives you retain the more you pay.</li>
<li>However, how much space you use depends on your backup strategy:</li>
<li>Fast access: lightly compressed (or not at all). All data is essentially duplicated on each archive.</li>
<li>High efficiency: Heavy compression and deduplication. Huge storage saving, at the cost of data access speed.</li>
<li>
<p>Combine both strategy: Fast access for recent backup archives (say, the last 7 days of data) and high efficiency for everything else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tarsnap vs zbackup</p>

<li>
<p>offsite rsync</p>

<p>backup rotation</p>
